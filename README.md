# ðŸŽ’ NodeLife Ecosystem â€“ Smart Backpack Project

This repository documents the **NodeLife Ecosystem** project â€” a smart backpack concept designed to integrate technology into everyday carry for enhanced convenience, safety, and productivity.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
The NodeLife Ecosystem combines **IoT features, smart compartments, and power management** into a single backpack design. The project research included:
- User needs analysis through surveys
- Design concept generation and evaluation
- Sustainability and innovation considerations
- Prototyping recommendations

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- **Final_Report.pdf** â†’ Contains the complete research, methodology, survey results, and high-fidelity design concepts.
- **Survey_Form.pdf** â†’ The original survey used to collect user feedback.
- **Google Sheets xlsx file** â†’ Data collection spreadsheet 

> **Note:** All diagrams, product sketches, and design pictures are embedded in the final report.  
> This repository does **not** include original design asset files (e.g., editable CAD/Photoshop files).

## ðŸ›  Methodology Summary
1. Conducted a **survey** to understand target user needs.
2. Analyzed responses to identify design requirements.
3. Created concept sketches and evaluated them based on criteria such as comfort, weight distribution, and tech integration.
4. Compiled final recommendations and roadmap for future prototyping.

## ðŸ“Š Survey Insights
